## Release date: 2018/01/06

## Inspiration
### Gabriel Lebec @glebec
Some of this functions are fom a *Lambda talk* that I saw online, if you really want a nice and complete documentation of combinators and lambda calculus in general, I definetly recommend checking out [lambda-talk repo](https://github.com/glebec/lambda-talk) and the [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4) from **Gabriel Lebec**

### Jeremy Fairbank @jfairbank
This is also a great talk. **Jeremy Fairbank** shows a set of concepts and functional programming structures for **JavaScript today**. Again, if you want to know more about programming and testing and all that good stuff, checkout [Jeremy's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIF0e4G6TQ7RNqauicoy10g)
